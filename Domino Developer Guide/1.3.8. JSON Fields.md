# JSON Fields

Though Domino does not have a native JSON or similarly-structured field type, Darwino adapters can mark fields as being of the "JSON" type for conversion. With this type in place, such fields will be stored as strings in Domino and "unmarshalled" back to the full JSON representation in Darwino. Though this type is generally intended for objects, it will work with any JSON-compatible data type, such as strings and arrays.

For example, take an adapter that includes a form block like:

```groovy
form('JSONExample') {
	field "FirstName"
  	field "LastName"
  	field "Phone", type:JSON
}
```

In Darwino, the JSON represenation may look like:

```json
{
	"firstname": "Joe",
  	"lastname": "Schmoe",
	"phone": {
		"work": "1-555-555-5555",
		"home": "1-555-555-5556"
	}
}
```

This document would be translated to Domino like (represented with C-style escapes):

```plai
FirstName: "Joe"
LastName: "Schmoe"
Phone: "{\"work\":\"1-555-555-5555\",\"home\":\"1-555-555-5556\"}"
```

Since Domino lacks any native JSON handling in @Formula or LotusScript, this format limits the usefulness of the data in most situations on the Domino side, but can nonetheless be useful as a way to round-trip data in a more-advanced Darwino application, or to make better use of existing JSON-formatted data stored in Domino.
