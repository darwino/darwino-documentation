Installing the Eclipse IDE
--------------------------

Although the use of an IDE, and in particular Eclipse, is not a requirement, it
certainly eases the development of Darwino applications.

In order to configure web servers and get the best web development experience,
please download and install the latest version of '**Eclipse IDE for Java EE
Developers**â€˜ (NOT Eclipse IDE for Java Developers).
<http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>

Darwino has been validated with Eclipse 4.5.1, also known as Mars-1.

Installing Eclipse is achieved by unzipping the archive in its target directory.
The following directory structure shows eclipse unzipped into the c:\\Darwino
directory:

Launching Eclipse for the first time
------------------------------------

When Eclipse is launched for the first time, it prompts for a workspace
directory.  The default value is fine, but well, you could also make this
directory a peer of the eclipse one, to get the whole environment contained
within `c:\Darwino`:

Configuring Eclipse
-------------------

Darwino requires some extra plug-ins bellow to be installed on top of the
version of Eclipse. These plug-ins can generally be installed from the Eclipse
Marketplace or by selecting `Help->Install New Software...`, then use the
provided update site URL

-   For developing Web (J2EE) applications
    -   M2E WTP **Note**: your version of Eclipse J2EE edition, if it is recent enough, might already have this feature installed. In this case, just skip this step. Select `Help->Eclipse Marketplace...` and search for `m2e wtp`. Be careful to install m2e-wtp matching your Eclipse version and *not* m2eclipse-wtp, which is deprecated.

-   If Android is a desired target platform
    -   Android Development Tools (aka ADT), Select `Help->Eclipse->Marketplace...` and search for `android adt`.
    -   Android for Maven Eclipse Select `Help->Eclipse Marketplace...` and search for `m2e android`.

-   If iOS is a desired target platform
    -   RoboVM, Follow the instructions under "*RoboVM for Eclipse*" from
<http://docs.robovm.com/getting-started/eclipse.html>

-   If IBM Domino is a desired target platform
    -   The Darwino project wizard as well as the sample applications use Tycho to target OSGi platforms (Eclipse, IBM Domino...). As a result, it requires the Tycho m2e connector to be installed. The easiest way to get it installed is to wait from Eclipse to display a build problem (see bellow), right click on the issue and choose quick fix. Eclipse will automatically propose to download and install the connector.
