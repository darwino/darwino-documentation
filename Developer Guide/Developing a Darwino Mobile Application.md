Developing a Darwino Mobile Application
=======================
# General information about mobile applications
Creating a mobile application in Darwino is like creating a J2EE application, except that instead of building a project that generates a WAR, you build a project that generates whatever the mobile device is expecting: an APK in the case of Android, or an IPA for iOS.

Because Darwino uses the Android and Multi-OS Engine SDKs, the projects that the Darwino wizard generates for those platforms must include what those SDKs are expecting.

When creating a mobile app, the wizard offers a choice of either native app or hybrid app.
