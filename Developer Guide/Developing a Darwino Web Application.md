Developing a Darwino J2EE Web Application
=======================
To support a Darwino J2EE application, you need to have an application server such a Tomcat or WebSphere that supports the Servlet API. 

Darwino provides a broad set of features and support services to a web application. It is possible to create an application that makes use of Darwino DB without using the other services that Darwino provides, such as creating connections and handling replication, but by using the pre-built services in the full Darwino package, the programmer will avoid a lot of unnecessary work.
