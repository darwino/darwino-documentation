# Darwino application objects

## Application
The Darwino application is a singleton. There is one and only one running instance. The Application instance is the entry point for all of the application options, including the manifest (the Application's getManifest() method will return the manifest object).

It is through the Application object that we can perform application-wide actions such as triggering replication.


## Manifest
The Application Manifest generated by the Darwino wizard defines the options for the Darwino application layer. The options defined here - such as the database names used in replication, the label and description of the application, and the application's url - are shared among all platforms.
```
DarwinoApplication app = DarwinoApplication.get();
DarwinoManifest mf = app.getManifest();

_formatText("Label: {0}",mf.getLabel());
_formatText("Description: {0}",mf.getDescription());
_formatText("Main Database: {0}",mf.getMainDatabase());

```

## Context
The Darwino Context provides the application with access to all of its environment information, including the user identity and the properties of the execution environment.

The Context has a different behavior depending on the platform, but it provides access to the same information.
```
DarwinoContext ctx = DarwinoContext.get();

_formatText("User: {0}",ctx.getUser());
_formatText("JsonStore Session: {0}",ctx.getSession()!=null);

```
