##Hybrid applications
A hybrid app will include all of the Darwino services, including the embedded HTTP server. This is what allows the app to provide a true offline experience with the exact same code running on the server and the mobile device.

This is better than a straight Apache Cordova application, although this framework can be used if desired.
