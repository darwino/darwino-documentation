## Manifest
The Application Manifest generated by the Darwino wizard defines the options for the Darwino application layer. The options defined here - such as the database names used in replication, the label and description of the application, and the application's url - are shared among all platforms.
```
DarwinoApplication app = DarwinoApplication.get();
DarwinoManifest mf = app.getManifest();

_formatText("Label: {0}",mf.getLabel());
_formatText("Description: {0}",mf.getDescription());
_formatText("Main Database: {0}",mf.getMainDatabase());

```

In addition to the global manifest, common to all of the platforms, there are per-platform manifests (J2EE, Mobile). These manifests hold the options specific to their particular platform.
