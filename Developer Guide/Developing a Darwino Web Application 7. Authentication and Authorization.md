# Authentication and Authorization
Security can be done at the web application level, for example with J2EE’s Container security or WebSphere’s Administration Console. Alternatively, it can be handled via Darwino’s authentication filter.

Darwino’s authentication filter provides basic authentication and form-based authentication, and it can work with a directory implemented as a Darwino database.
