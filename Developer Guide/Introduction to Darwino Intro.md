#Introduction#


Welcome Darwino! Darwino is an open platform for rapidly developing social business applications targeting primarily Mobile and the Cloud. Importantly, Darwino allows developers to focus on the application, and not on platform specific issues or wiring to other platforms/data sources. Because of this, Darwino greatly reduces the time needed for you to deliver value to your customers. Darwino's full stack of ready-to-run components and connectors allow you to design applications that run locally on any mobile device, connected to any back end data source, with next to no platform-specific coding. Finally, Darwino leverages the skills of any Java developer - allowing Java developers to move to build enterprise mobile applications with no additional training.

This developer's guide will help you to learn the specifics of Darwino, and to build applications in no time. The following is a high-level overview of Darwino that will get you kick-started.
