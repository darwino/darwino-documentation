JavaScript APIs
=======================
# 1	Loading the Javascript files

The JavaScript implementation’s source is compacted and compressed into one file: Darwino.js. This is the one file to include in applications; there is no reason to include the non-compressed files.
```
<script src=”$darwino-libs/Darwino/Darwino.js”></script>
```

Note: While it won’t break anything to load the JavaScript library more than once, it should be avoided because the browser will waste time loading and parsing it.

The JavaScript API can be explored in the ["JavaScript Snippets"](http://playground.darwino.com/playground.nsf/JavaScriptSnippets.xsp) section of the Darwino Playground.
