Business APIs
=======================
# General information
The business APIs are an integral part of the core Darwino environment. These APIs encapsulate a set of services, providing an easy-to-use, platform-independent interface to assist in coding common business application functions. 

There are currently two business APIs: The User Service and the Mail Service. This set of APIs is architected to grow over time.
