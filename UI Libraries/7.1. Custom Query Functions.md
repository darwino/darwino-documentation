# Custom query functions

The Darwino query/extration language allows the creation of custom functions.
!! If such functions can be used in both query and data extraction expression, bear in mind that they might slow down the query as it cannot be fully processed by the underlying SQL database.

As an example, the demo application defines the '$USState' function that returns the label of state for a given code.

Here is how it is implemented

## Creating the function
As the function could be executed on both server and mobile environment, it is defined in the shared project. The name of the function is `OpUSState`, which inherits indirectly from `com.darwino.commons.json.query.nodes.Node`. 
The main method is `execute`, which uses a context to calculate the resulting value. Many examples of such functions or operators are provided as part of the Darwino source code.

## Registering the new function
The new function has to be registered using a factory provided through a standard Darwino extension. In the example, the factory is called `AppQueryExtension`. It currently only defines one function but it can define as many desired.
The factory itself should be registered by the application plugin (`AppBasePlugin` in the example):

		if(serviceClass==QueryExtension.class) {
			extensions.add(new AppQueryExtension());
		}
