# Common Code
The Darwino JavaScript UI libraries are available as ES6 modules through npm. They use a private repository identified named @darwino.

# Available libraries
The Darwino npm server features a set of reusable JavaScript libraries:

- **@darwino/darwino**
Core, pure Darwino JavaScript library that contain a set of useful utilities (access to the datastore, users, ...).
- **@darwino/darwino-react**
Base react components used to create form based application. These components do not preclude any UI framework and thus should not be directly used. They provide the base behavior for derived components.
- **@darwino/darwino-react-bootstrap**
Extension of the Darwino react components targeting Twitter boostrap. These are concrete components, ready to use.
- **@darwino/darwino-react-bootstrap-notes**
Some specialized Darwino react-bootstrap components providing features and behavior similar to the IBM Notes rich client UI. These are mostly to be used in migration scenarios.
