# Darwino Libraries
Darwino is made of several JavaScript libraries within the `@darwino` scope, distributed via a private npm server. Some libraries depend on a particular technology (ReactJS, Bootstrap...) and some do not. They are, somehow, organized in an hierarchy.

## Available libraries
Here is the list of the available libraries:

- **@darwino/darwino**
Core, pure Darwino JavaScript library that contain a set of useful utilities (access to the datastore, users, ...).

- **@darwino/darwino-react**
Base ReactJS components used to create form based applications. These components do not preclude any rendering framework and thus should not be directly used. They provide the base behavior for derived components, which is the reason why the components start with the `Base` prefix.

- **@darwino/darwino-react-bootstrap**
Extension of the Darwino ReactJS components targeting Twitter boostrap. These are concrete components, ready to use.

- **@darwino/darwino-react-bootstrap-notes**
Some specialized Darwino react-bootstrap components, providing features and behavior similar to the IBM Notes rich client UI. These are mostly to be used in migration scenarios.
