# Validation

Darwino uses the regular redux-form validation function.

## Form validation
The whole form can be validated through a document form `validate()` function, see: [https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/examples/syncvalidation/](https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/examples/syncvalidation/)

Redux form library also features asynchronous validation when necessary. See: [https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/examples/asyncvalidation/](https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/examples/asyncvalidation/)

The errors being returned by the validation functions are in fact a JSON object with an entry per field with an error message. The Darwino UI components, `renderXXXX`,  will display the error messages next to each field with an error.

    validate(values) {
        const errors = {};
        // Add the validation rules here!
        if(!values.firstname) {
            errors.firstname = "Missing First Name"
        }
        return errors;
    }

See: `Contacts.jsx`

## Field validation
The validation can also happen at the field level.
