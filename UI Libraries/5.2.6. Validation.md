# Validation

Darwino uses the regular redux-form validation functiom,

## Form validation
The whole form can be validated through a document form `validate()` function, see: https://redux-form.com/7.0.0/examples/syncvalidation/

The errors being returned are in fact a JSON object with an entry per field with the error message. The Darwino UI Components will display the error messages next to each field with an error.

    validate(values) {
        const errors = {};
        // Add the validation rules here!
        if(!values.firstname) {
            errors.firstname = "Missing First Name"
        }
        return errors;
    }

See: `Contacts.jsx`

## Field validation
The validation can also happen at the field level, see: https://redux-form.com/7.0.0/examples/fieldlevelvalidation/
