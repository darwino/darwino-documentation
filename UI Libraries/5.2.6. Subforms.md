# Read Only Forms and Fields

Fields can have 3 states:
- Editable
This is the normal state, allowing a user to edit the value
- Disabled
The editable control is displayed with the value, but it is not editable
- Readonly
The editable control is replaced a piece of static HTML, generally a text

## Controlling the display mode
The component mode is controlled via the `disabled` & `readOnly` properties. They have to be passed explicitly to every single control. When absent, hen the control is in normal editable mode.

## Form display mode
A form can carry flag for disabled or readOnly. These flags are part of the form state, but are accessed using getters:
- isReadOnly()
- isDisabled()
- isEditable()
- getMode()

By default, the form is in a DEFAULT_MODE, which means that the actual mode (editable or disabled) is deduced from the document security. If the document is read only, then DEFAULT_MODE means disabled. But this value can be forced using the `setMode()` method.

Typically, component mode is set to every component in a form like this:

    render() {
        const readOnly = this.isReadOnly();
        const disabled = this.isDisabled();
        ...
        return (
            ...
            <Field name="firstname" type="text" component={renderText} label="First Name" disabled={disabled} readOnly={readOnly}/>
