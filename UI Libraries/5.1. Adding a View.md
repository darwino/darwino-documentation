# Adding a view

A view, in Darwino, is actually a query to the database being displayed as a grid or a list of entries. The developer will have to do a few tasks:

1. Define the database query
2. Create the UI for the view
3. Eventually, add the view to the navigator

Darwino provides a ready to use, responsive Grid component to display the content of a view. But the view entries can also be displayed using custom markup. Darwino has somne helpers to access the back-end data.

Here is an example of a data grid:

## Defining the query
The query can be defined dynamically in the UI control (the data grid), or created as part of the application and then referenced by name. We're going to use the later, as it is a good idea to pre-define these queries.
By default, such a query is a file of type `.cursor` located in the `DARWINO-INF/cursors` resources of your project. In the demo application, the queries are in the `contacts-react-webui` project:

Each query is a JSON file containing the query definition. The name of the file is also the name used to reference that query when calling the REST service.

Here is some sample query content, from `AllCompaniesByIndustry.cursor`:

    {
      "store": "companies",
      "extract": {
        "Industry": "industry",
        "State": {$USState: "$state"},
        "Name": "name",
        "form": "form"
      },
      "query": "{form: 'Company'}",
      "options": "DATA_MODDATES",
      "orderBy": "industry,state"
    }

## Creating the view UI
The UI can be done multiple ways, up to manually rendering. But Darwino provides a convenient UI Data Grid component that can be used to display a view, if this is the desired UI. This component provides many advanced capabilities out of the-box, like dynamic sorting, categorization, collapsible children documents, totalization rows, responsive design...
A typical view page is a JavaScript file containing 2 components: the grid component with eventually some customization, and the page component containing the grid component plus others (action bar...). Isolating the grid in its own component allows its reuse in multiple places in the application (picker using the grid, embedded grid in a form...).

As an example, the `AllCompanyByIndustry.jsx` defines such a view. The most important properties are the grid ones, defined there as `defaultProps`.

## Adding the view to the navigator
There are 2 steps in referencing a view in the navigator:

1. Define the route path to reach the view
This defines the URL used by the router to access the view. It associates a path with the page component to display. This way, the URL becomes bookmarkable.

        <Route exact path="/app/allcompaniesbyindustry" 
          component={AppAllCompaniesByIndustry}>
        </Route>
        
2. Add the view to the UI navigator
This is done in the `Navigator.jsx` with a `NavLink` component.

        <NavLink to="/app/allcompaniesbyindustry">By Industry/State</NavLink>
