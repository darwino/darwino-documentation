# Adding a form

A form is simply a ReactJS component used to edit the data coming from a REST service. The data is handled through Redux, and more specifically through [Redux Form](https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/).
To ease the process of creating form, Darwino provides some easy to use components:
1. A base class for the form, handling the communication with the server, calculated fields and other helpser
2. Some edit components doing the data binding with the document

## Creating a Form
A form component should inherit from 

    import {DocumentForm} from '@darwino/darwino-react-bootstrap'
    class Company extends DocumentForm {
      ...
