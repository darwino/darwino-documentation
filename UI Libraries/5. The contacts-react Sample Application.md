# The contacts-react sample application

Darwino delivers a sample application to show case the different capability of the library. The source of the whole application is available on Github:
[https://github.com/darwino/darwino-demo/tree/master/darwino-demo/contacts-react](https://github.com/darwino/darwino-demo/tree/master/darwino-demo/contacts-react)

This application is actually a port of a sample Notes/Domino application. The source NSF database is provided in the root of the project. Moreover, the NSF contains some XPages you can use to generate a default dataset.

Obviously, Darwino can be configured to replicate the data between the NSF and the new Darwino application. As it uses some advanced capabilities, like using a different store for different kinds of documents, we provide a customer replication adapter available in the project root: [DatabaseAdapter.txt](https://github.com/darwino/darwino-demo/blob/master/darwino-demo/contacts-react/DatabaseAdapter.txt).

The following sub-chapters are describing how some common tasks can be achieved.
