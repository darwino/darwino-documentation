# Building a React/Bootstrap application

The Darwino wizard created a application skeleton with the following folders and files:

Let's look at the different files:

- **index.html**
This is the main application page to launch. It contains the meta-data of the page, and a `<div>` that will host the whole ReactJS application. This is a pure HTML page.

- **client.jsx**
This is the main ReactJS page. It loads the JavaScript code, initializes all the libraries and instantiates the main `Layout.jsx` component.

- **Layout.jsx**
This lays out the whole page using the bootstrap library. It creates a header, a footer, a body and a navigator. It takes advantage of the responsive capability of the bootstrap library to adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Navigator.jsx**
This is the main navigation menu, displayed by default on the left side of the screen. In a typical responsive application, it can be hidden and appear with a "burger" icon.

- **Header.jsx**
This is a header, displaying by default the company brand and the current user.

- **Footer.jsx**
This is the footer, displaying by default a simple copyright string.

- **Home.jsx**
This is the home page, as the first choice in the left Navigator.
