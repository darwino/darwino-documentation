# Subforms

The Darwino library supports subforms. Subforms are more than just components, as they can contribute some behaviors to the parent form, as if they were in the form.

- Calculated fields

    `defaultValues()`
    `calculateOnLoad()`
    `calculateOnChange()`
- Validation

    `validate()`
- Action bar

    `contributeActionBar()`

It also has easy to use functions to access the field values.
A Subform is also a React-Bootstrap `FormSection`, which means that it can be used to access hierarchical data.

See: `CCAddress.jsx`

## How does that work
The form component maintains a list of subform. Each subform contributes itself to the main form when it is mounted (in a ReactJS sense), and removes itself from the form when it is unmounted.
