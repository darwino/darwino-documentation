# Subforms

The Darwino library supports subforms. Subforms are more than just components, as they can contribute some behaviors to the parent form, as if they were provided by the form itself:

- Calculated fields

    `defaultValues()`
    `calculateOnLoad()`
    `calculateOnChange()`

- Validation

    `validate()`

- Action bar

    `contributeActionBar()`

It also has easy to use functions to access the form and the field values:

- `getForm()`
- `getFieldValue(field)`
- `setFieldValue(field,value)`

Finally, a subform is also a React-Bootstrap `FormSection`, which means that it can be used to access hierarchical data.

See: `CCAddress.jsx`

## How does that work
The form component maintains a list of subforma. Each subform contributes itself to the main form when it is mounted (in a ReactJS sense), and removes itself from the form when it is unmounted.
