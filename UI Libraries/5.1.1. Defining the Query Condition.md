# Defining the query condition

A query points to a database and a store. If nothing else is provided, then all the documents from the store are retrieved

## Adding a query condition
A query condition is defined by the `query` attribute in the query definition:

    {
      "query": "{firstName: 'Jones'}",
    }
This uses the standard Darwino query language and can be as complex as needed. Some examples are available in the playground:

## Selecting Notes/Domino documents based on a form
When documents are replicated from Notes/Domino, then the Form field contains the form and a query can be applied as bellow:

    {
      "query": "{form: 'Company'}",
    }


## Retrieving children documents
Children documents can be retrieved using the `parentid` attribute. Generally, this parent ID should not be hard coded in the query itself, but passed dynamically from the view component. This is done in the UI Grid component itself. The `Company.jsx` form shows how to display an embedded view using the current document as the parent:

        <CursorGrid
          databaseId={Constants.DATABASE}
          params={ {
            name: "AllCompanyDocuments",
            parentid: this.state.unid
          } }
          showResponses={true}
          columns={[
            {name: "Title", key: "Title", sortable: true, sortField: 'title'},
          ]}
        />
