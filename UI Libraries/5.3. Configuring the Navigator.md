# Configuring the navigator

The Darwino library uses the [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) library to map the URLs to pages and handle the navigation (back button, ...), while being in a single page application.

## Navigator entries
In the demo app, the left side navigator is configured in `Navigator.jsx`. Each entry is provided through a `NavLink` component, which set the routing path and also highlight the current entry:

    <NavLink to="/app/allcompanies">All Companies</NavLink>

## Router 
The React Router has a `Switch` component to select what component to render based on the current URL. This is done in the `Layout.jsx` component. Every route (e.g. component to display base on a URL) is defined in a Route component, like bellow:

    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/app/allcompanies" component={AppAllCompanies}></Route>
      <Route exact path="/app/company/" component={AppCompany}></Route>
      <Route exact path="/app/company/:unid" component={AppCompany}></Route>

The example above shows 2 different kind of routes:
1. allcompanies, routing to a view, with no parameter. These URL
2. company and company/:unid, routing to a form with an optional single parameter `unid`. When the unid is available, then the corresponding document will be loaded. Else, a new document will be created.
