# Editing the raw JSON content

In some rare cases, for example for some admin tasks, you'd lie the user to directly edit the JSON content in a text area instead of using a well designed form.
See: `AllCompaniesAsJson.jsx` and `CompanyAsJson.jsx`.

The `redux-form` library does not make that task easy as you cannot easily read/write the whole JSON content. Moreover, converting the JSON content to text, back and forth, might lead to different JSON text content as the JSON property order is not predictable.

A quick solution is to not use `redux-form` for such an editor, but instead use straight ReactJS capability. But this prevents from using the library components, as well as the pre-built document load/save capabilities.

There is another easy to implement solution: the whole document content should be 'stringified' and temporary stored as an attribute within the document. Once this is done,  it can be edited as a regular text based attribute. Finally, before saving, the JSON text is converted back to a JSON object and assigned to the document. This is done by implementing the following two methods of the form component:

    // Convert the whole document content as a 'json' property into the document
    // This property must be the only one to be edited going forward
    prepareForDisplay(values) {
        const json = JSON.stringify(values,null," ");
        values.json = json;
    }

    // Read back the JSON property as text and set its content to the values parameters
    // 'values' is a temporary object that will be saved to the database
    prepareForSave(values) {
        const json = values.json ? JSON.parse(values.json) : {}
        for (var p in values) if (values.hasOwnProperty(p)) delete values[p];
        Object.assign(values,json)
    }


## JSON Validation
The user can enter some invalid JSON which should prevent the document from being saved, while an error message is rendered to the user.
Because the JSON text is a simple document attribute, it can be vaidated as any other attribute:

    validate(values) {
        const errors = {};
        const json = values.json;
        if(json) {
            try {
                JSON.parse(json);
            } catch (e) {
                errors.json = "Invalid JSON value"
            }
        }
        return errors;
    }
