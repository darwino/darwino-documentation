# Full Text Search

Darwino cursor queries can be used to execute full text search on the JSON data. Behind the scene, Darwino uses the built-in database full text search capability. On some databases, like MS SQL Server or IBM DB2, the relational databases have to be initialized properly to enable the feature. Failing to do that will generate runtime errors.

## How the Full Text Search Works
The whole JSON document, or only a subset of it, can be indexed to support full text search. As most relational databases don't know how to index JSON, Darwino is storing a copy the data to index into a specific table. This has to be defined in the database definition, for each single store:

    _Store store = db.addStore("mystore");
    store.setLabel("My Store");
    store.setFtSearchEnabled(true);
    _FtSearch ft = store.setFTSearch(new _FtSearch());
    ft.setFields("$");

In this example, the whole document (`"$"`) is being indexed

## Can the Full Text Search be Enhanced
Darwino created an API that works with many different databases, without leveraging every specific database capabilities. But, as this is built on relational databases, one can create specific database indexes and then use them directly with SQL.
