# JSQL

## What is JSQL
JSQL is a SQL like query language where basically the table are replace by JSON store names and the table columns by simple JSON paths (`$.x.y.z`).
Internally, JSQL is converted to the database native SQL and executed.

## Executing a JSQL query in Java
A query can be executed using the Java API, by instanciating a JSQL cursor, setting options and executing the query. The result is an array of rows, where each row is a row from the SQL rowset

## Executing a JSQL query using REST services
JSQL queries can be executed using REST services.

## Passing parameters to JSQL queries
JSQL queries can use parameters within the SQL. They are identified by `:<name>` and replaced at runtime. Here is an example of a `:brand` parameter:

    SELECT P.$.name name, P.$.brand brand
    	FROM pinball P
    	WHERE LOWER(P.$.brand)=LOWER(:brand)

## Registered JSQL queries
If queries can be executed dynamically, they can also be registered by name. Registered queries are retrieved using a factory assigned store factory. A common practice is to put the queries in `DARWINO-INF/jsql` as `*.jsql` files, and use the predefined factory like bellow:
`setJsqlQueryFactory(new DarwinoInfJsqQueryFactory(getClass()));`

See: https://github.com/darwino/darwino-demo/blob/develop/darwino-demo/contacts-react/contacts-react-shared/src/main/java/com/contacts/app/AppDBBusinessLogic.java

A registered query is loaded in Java by using `load()`. This requests the definition from the extension:
`JsonArray json = (JsonArray)session.openJsqlCursor().load("MyQuery");`

See: https://playground.darwino.com/playground.nsf/JavaSnippets.xsp#snippet=Json_Store_Jsql_Run_Predefined_Query

From REST services, the parameter `name` should be used to reference a predefined query. Note that a list of registered queries is available with `/list`
