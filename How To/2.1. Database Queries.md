# Database queries
Darwino offers two different mechanisms for querying the JSON store: cursor based queries and JSQL. The former is designed upon MongoDB query language, with extensions, while the second is a flavor of SQL adapted to JSON store. Depending on your use case, you may pick one of the other.

## When to use each query language
Cursor queries are meant to be simpler and database independent, while JSQL ones are closer to the relational database

### Cursor Query
- For queries involving a single database
- For queries with selection formula that cannot be executed by the database (be careful of the performance)
- When using query fields (@fields) extracted at document saving time
- When retrieving categorized data, with or without aggregated data
- When retrieving hierarchies of documents (parent/children relationship)
- When migrating Notes/Domino view, particularly when using @formula for the columns

### JSQL
- For queries involving multiple databases, using joins, union, ... and other relational operations
- For complex calculation with subqueries
- When the full power of SQL is requested for complex queries
